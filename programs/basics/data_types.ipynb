    "- A variable is simply a name to which a value can be assigned.\n",
    "- Variables are mutable and can be reassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Convention\n",
    "- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "- The name can start with an upper or lower case alphabet.\n",
    "- All name are case sensitive.\n",
    "- Number can appear in the name, but not at the beginning.\n",
    "- `_` character can appear anywhere in the name.\n",
    "- Spacing are not allowed in the name. We must use snake_case to separate words.\n",
    "- Name of the variable should be descriptive and meaningful."

    "\n",
    "## Integers\n",
    "- The integer data type is comprised of all the positive and negative whole numbers.\n",
    "- The amount of memory an integer occupies depends on its value.\n",
    "- All negative integers start with a `-` sign.\n",

    "## Floating point numbers\n",
    "- Floating-point numbers, or floats, refer to positive and negative decimal numbers.\n",
    "- This ensures accurate computations for precise values.\n",
    "- A float occupies 24 bytes of memory.\n",

    "## Complex numbers\n",
    "- Complex numbers are represented by the real and imaginary parts.\n",
    "- It requires two values. The first one will be the real part of the complex number, while the second value will be the imaginary part.\n",
    "- The imaginary part is denoted by `j` or `J`.\n",

    "## Length of a string\n",
    "- The length of a string can be found using the `len()` built-in function.\n",
    "- In a string, every character is given a numerical index based on its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing\n",
    "- A string in Python is indexed from 0 to n-1 where n is its length. This means that the index of the first character in a string is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accesing Characters\n",
    "- Each character in a string can be accessed using its index. The index must be closed within square brackets, [], and appended to the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reversing Indexing\n",
    "- The index of the last character in a string can be accessed using a negative index.\n",
    "- We can also change our indexing convention by using negative indices.\n",
    "- Negative indices start from the opposite end of the string. Hence, the -1 index corresponds to the last character:\n",
    "\n",
    "## String Immutability\n",
    "- Strings are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
    "- Remember, assigning a new value to string variable doesn’t mean that you’ve changed the value. Instead, you’ve reassigned the variable to a new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ASCII vs Unicode\n",
    "- ASCII is a 7-bit character set that can represent 128 different characters.\n",
    "- Unicode is a 16-bit character set that can represent 65,536 different characters.\n",
    "- In Python 3.x, all strings are unicode. But, older versions of Python (Python 2.x) support only ASCII characters. To use unicode in Python 2.x, preceding the string with a u is must."
